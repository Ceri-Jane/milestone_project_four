                That’s completely okay — you can keep using Regulate’s core features as
                normal without a paid plan.

                If you change your mind later, you can start a <strong>5-day free trial</strong>
                any time from your dashboard. You won’t be charged until the trial ends,
                and you can cancel before then if it doesn’t feel right.
