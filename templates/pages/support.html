        <p class="form-info">
            Regulate is a self-support tool, but sometimes you need real-world help.
            If you’re in danger or feel unsafe, please use the options below.
        </p>

        <h3>Immediate danger</h3>
        <p>
            If you are in immediate danger or feel you might act on harmful thoughts:

            <li>Go to your nearest A&E</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            You don’t have to be suicidal to contact them — you can call if you’re struggling,

        </p>

        <h3>NHS 111</h3>
        <p>
            For urgent mental health support that isn’t an emergency:

            <li>Discuss therapy, medication, or support services</li>
            <li>Be referred to talking therapies or specialist teams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You don’t need to be “at breaking point” to speak to your GP — early support matters.
